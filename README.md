**Calories Burnt Prediction using Machine Learning**

**Overview**
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting calories burnt based on various features. 
The project utilizes popular machine learning libraries such as **scikit-learn, XGBoost, and seaborn for data visualization.**

**Features**
Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost regression models are implemented for predicting calories burnt.
The dataset is preprocessed using scikit-learn's **StandardScaler** and **OrdinalEncoder**.

**Model evaluation** is performed using the R-squared metric, and cross-validation is employed to assess the model's robustness.


**Libraries and Tools**
**seaborn**: Used for data visualization.
**matplotlib**: Used for creating plots and charts.
**scikit-learn**: Utilized for machine learning models, preprocessing, and evaluation.
**XGBoost**: Employed for implementing the XGBoost regression model.
